Buddhist literatures cited that Lumbini is the place where the newly born Prince Siddhartha took his first seven steps and uttered an epoch-making message to the suffering humanity. This happened exactly in the beautiful sal grove, the garden renowned for the beauty of its shady grove of lush green trees and colorful flowers. Maya Devi, the queen of Sakya King Suddhodan of Kapilavastu, while was passing through the Lumbini Garden, on the way to her maternal home Devadaha, in the day of ‘Vaisakha Poornima’ (the full moon-day of May 623 BC), took bath in the Pushkarni (the Sacred Pond) and proceeded towards the north. Suddenly, she felt lever pain, took decent support of a tree branch and holding it, she gave birth to the Crown Prince Siddhartha.

It is located in the western Tarai of Nepal holds a historic event in the Buddhist world. The classical texts of Suttanipata, Mahaparinibana Sutta and Divyavadana Lumbini mentioned that the Buddha advised his followers to visit Lumbini at once – the area which crossed by three rivers, the Harahawa, Ghoraha and Tela. The area has a sub-tropical monsoon climate with a warm wet season. The Lumbini Garden covers an area of 1x3 sq miles (2.56 sq km) and encompasses three zones each covering one square mile, united by a walkway and a canal. (Lumbini as a Fountain of World Peace, Shakya, MB, 2000)
